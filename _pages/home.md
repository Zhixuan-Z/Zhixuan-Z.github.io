### Biography

The slowdown of Moore’s law coupled with the rapid growth in code and data size, especially in data centers, has significantly reshaped hardware and software designs. Consequently, applications suffer frequent microarchitectural cache misses and corresponding stalls, causing major performance and energy inefficiencies. To address these inefficiencies, my vision is to fundamentally redesign microarchitectural structures from the ground up.

### About me

I am Zhixuan Zhang, a second year master student at Columbia University, advised by Tanvir Ahmed Khan.

I'm working on optimizing the Branch Target Buffer (BTB) hierarchy for modern data center applications. BTBs play a critical role in enhancing programs’ performance by reducing delays in fetching target addresses for branch or control-flow instructions. Instead of focusing only on one aspect of BTB efficacy, such as increasing branch density or employing adaptive prefetching techniques, my goal is to establish a unified methodology for comprehensively designing BTB hierarchy, integrating techniques such as prefetching, compression, hierarchy design, security measures, and replacement policies. This unified approach enables a balanced trade-off among various metrics and strategies, providing a solid foundation for future optimizations
