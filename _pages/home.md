### Biography

I am Zhixuan Zhang, a second year master student at Columbia University, advised by Tanvir Ahmed Khan.

I'm working on optimizing the Branch Target Buffer (BTB) hierarchy for modern data center applications. BTBs play a critical role in enhancing programsâ€™ performance by reducing delays in fetching target addresses for branch or control-flow instructions. Instead of focusing only on one aspect of BTB efficacy, such as increasing branch density or employing adaptive prefetching techniques, my goal is to establish a unified methodology for comprehensively designing BTB hierarchy, integrating techniques such as prefetching, compression, hierarchy design, security measures, and replacement policies. This unified approach enables a balanced trade-off among various metrics and strategies, providing a solid foundation for future optimizations


### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942.
After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs.
After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now at the California Institute of Technology.
